# FizzBuzz
I read about the FizzBuzz test that was supposedly administered to young programmers during their interviews. This would test whether or not they could utilize basic logic and simple mechanics of the language they said they knew. I take these stories with a huge grain of salt because the problem is so easy and the necessary knowledge of the language so basic, that it couldn't possibly work as a filter.

Nonetheless, I think it's a good exercise when learning a new language. Hence, I'll keep adding solutions to the test as I learn languages and become more proficient in them.
